### Recent Accomplishments:
‚úÖ **Complete UI Architecture:** All main views implemented with patient-centric design
‚úÖ **Accessibility Foundation:** Large text, high contrast, and screen reader support
‚úÖ **Compassionate Messaging:** Built into UserPreferences and UI components
‚úÖ **Privacy-First Design:** Granular controls in settings with clear explanations
‚úÖ **Flexible Data Models:** Support for snooze, variable scheduling, and context logging

### Next Priority: Phase 3 - Flexible Reminder System

## Key Design Principles Being Applied:
‚úÖ **Compassionate Design** - Non-judgmental, supportive tone
‚úÖ **Cognitive Load Reduction** - Simple, clear interfaces
‚úÖ **Flexibility** - Accommodating bad days and symptom variability
‚úÖ **Privacy First** - User control over data sharing
‚úÖ **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance, multiple input methods

## Notes & Decisions:
- Starting with SwiftData for local-first approach (privacy benefit)
- Using SwiftUI for modern, accessible interface
- Planning for offline-first functionality
- Designing models to support future voice input and provider integration
